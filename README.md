## 🌟 Quick Start (Q&A)

#### 🚩 Question 1. Where to start

Installing necessary packages.

```bash
# locate to the root of this project.
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 🚩 Question 2. Where could I reproduce MFedNI?

- We have provided [a showcase of MFedNI](./mfedni.ipynb).
- You might need to generate corresponding dataset before you start it, please see [./.dataset](./.dataset/) for further details.

#### 🚩 Question 3. How could I generate modal incomplete dataset?

Please see [./.dataset](./.dataset/) for further details.
